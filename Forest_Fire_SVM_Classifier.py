Introduced by Vladimir Vapnik and his colleagues in the 1960s, SVMs have since become a cornerstone of modern machine learning.'
    st.write(text)
    text = 'At their core, SVMs excel in finding optimal decision boundaries that separate data points belonging to different classes while maximizing the margin, or distance, between these boundaries. This unique characteristic allows SVMs to perform exceptionally well in scenarios where data may be complex, high-dimensional, or not linearly separable. Moreover, SVMs are known for their ability to generalize from training data to new, unseen examples, which makes them valuable tools for both classification and regression problems.'

It is provided as a compressed file ‚ÄúDataset.rar‚Äù. This archive contains two essential components: the training dataset and the test dataset. These datasets consist of images, each having a resolution of 250√ó250 pixels. The other dataset we used for checking the efficiency of our model is accessible form <a href="https://images.cv/download/forest_fire/948/CALL_FROM_SEARCH/%22forest_fire%22">images.cv</a>. In this dataset all images are of 256√ó256 pixels and all belong to the category of forest fire. They have been curated to focus specifically on imagery related to forest fires.'

    text = 'Our dataset comprises meticulously labeled images categorized as "fire" and "no-fire." The primary objective was to employ predictive methods to discern whether unseen test data fell into either the "fire" or "no-fire" category. Given the binary nature of this classification task, several techniques were at our disposal. Ultimately, we opted to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for this purpose. This SVM model was carefully trained to classify images and predict the occurrence of forest fires based on the visual content of the images. This choice was made after careful consideration of its suitability for binary classification tasks involving image data.'

    st.header('Procedure')
    text = 'Our dataset presented a challenge in that the number of data samples is notably low in comparison to the multitude of attributes considered. Specifically, we have utilized the RGB pixel values of images as these attributes. To address this issue, we undertook a series of preprocessing steps to enhance the dataset\'s suitability for analysis.'
    st.write(text)

    text = 'First, we resized the images in the training dataset to various resolutions, namely: 10x10, 20x20, 30x30, 40x40, 50x50, 60x60, 70x70, 80x80, 90x90, 100x100, 150x150, 200x200 and 250x250. This resizing was carried out solely on the training datasets to gain a better understanding of the interplay between the number of samples and the number of attributes.'

    text = 'Furthermore, in our pursuit of increasing the number of data samples, we applied median blur and horizontal flip to the images in the training data. These augmentation techniques increased the training data by a factor of 4 and were essential in the development of a more robust dataset for subsequent analysis.'

    text = 'We tried different kernels for SVM model namely linear, polynomial, sigmoid and Gaussian kernels for each of the resized training dataset to assess their performance. The Gaussian kernel displayed the best performance overall and the gave the best accuracy when the input image resolution was 250x250. The SVM model deployed here is the same model that had the best performance.'
